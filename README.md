# partial-screenshotter
Lightweight script that allows the user to select an area of the screen to capture in a screenshot. Designed for integration with AutoHotkey on Windows as a replacement to Windows' screenshoot tools, which require several steps to use.

Use: 

Once installed, simply press the key of your choice to start the script. When you see the cursor change to a cross, click and drag to select the area you want to capture. It's immediately sent to the desktop and the script closes. This was designed to be as simple and lightweight as possible.

Installation:

2) Edit the paths for your Python instllation and the script in the provided ahk file.
3) Run the provided AutoHotkey file to bind the script to your Pause key.
